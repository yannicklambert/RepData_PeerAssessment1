# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r echo=FALSE}

setwd("D:\\temp\\")

activity = read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))

activity=na.omit(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r }

tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, FUN = median)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r }

hist(activity$date,activity$steps, breaks=60)
```



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
